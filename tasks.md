## Enhance User Profile Gallery Sections (LoRAs, Generations, Art)

- **Goal:** Improve the visual presentation of gallery sections on the user profile page, particularly when the last row is not full, without affecting the overall layout height.

- **Steps:**
  1.  **Created `src/components/DummyCard.tsx`:**
      - A simple functional component.
      - Renders a `div` with a fixed height (`h-64`) matching the approximate height of `LoraCard` and `VideoCard`.
      - Applies a pseudo-random background color based on its `id` prop for visual variety.
      - Uses a subtle inner shadow and slight opacity.
  2.  **Modified `src/pages/UserProfilePage.tsx`:**
      - Imported the `DummyCard` component.
      - **Added Dummy Placeholders:** For each section (LoRAs, Generations, Art), appended 4 `DummyCard` instances to the list of items rendered by the `Masonry` component. These are only added if the respective section has items.
      - **Compensated for Dummy Height:** Applied a negative bottom margin (`-mb-64`) to the `div` wrapping each `Masonry` grid. This pulls subsequent content up, preventing the dummy cards from increasing the perceived height of the section.
      - **Adjusted Pagination Layering:** Added `relative z-10` to the `Pagination` component returned by `renderPaginationControls`. This ensures the pagination controls render visually on top of the dummy cards.
      - **Added Conditional Footer Bar:** Inside the `div` wrapping the `Masonry` grid, added an absolutely positioned white bar (`h-8 bg-white absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-5`). This bar is only rendered if pagination is visible (`totalPages > 1`) and sits visually between the pagination controls and the dummy cards.

- **Outcome:** The LoRA, Generations, and Art sections now have placeholder cards filling the space below the last row of content when pagination is present. The layout adjusts correctly with negative margins and z-indexing to maintain consistent section height and ensure pagination remains usable.
