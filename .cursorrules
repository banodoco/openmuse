- when asked to make a change, try understand what the user needs. If they you to search, use the tools. If you need to understand the structure, look at the file structure.md to understand where you need to make changes. If need be, search up the relevant file for context. Try to find and use common components if they exist.
- When the user asks to push to github, run "git diff | cat" to figure out what was changed - update structure.md, see below - and then make a one command like "git add . && git commit -m "{include specific commit message feat/ a summary/explanation of the changes}" && git push". Start this process if appropriate with the user if you think they'll be done with a task.
- As per the above, you're pushing to Github - If there are structural changes - files add, deleted, or purposes of files changed - you should then update the appropriate place in structure.md.
