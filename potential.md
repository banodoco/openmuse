- `beb5404`: Very low probability. LoRA selector logic simplification.
- `219b03d`: Low probability. Refactored LoRA selector component implementation (cmdk).
- `57e2dca`: Very low probability. LoRA selector mouse interaction fix.
- `0c92a95`: Medium probability. Removed LoRA selector from media uploads entirely. Could affect logic relying on `associatedLoraIds` for non-LoRA-associated media.
- `3a258a6`: High probability. Major refactor replacing Masonry with VideoGrid, changing layout logic across multiple pages (Index, UserProfilePage, AssetDetail), updating aspect ratio/hover logic in VideoCard/LoraCard. Very likely source of layout/playback issues on mobile.
- `06bc5a3`: Very High probability. Introduced complex changes to VideoCard hover/lazy-loading logic (`combinedHovering`, `isInViewport`), added lightbox navigation, adjusted aspect ratio handling, and potentially removed/reverted the `VideoGrid` system. Changes in `VideoCard` interaction logic are highly suspect for mobile playback issues. Also modified `StorageVideoPlayer` loading/thumbnail logic (Medium probability). PlantAnimation added (Low probability).
- `9c9b89c`: Very low probability. Removed PlantAnimation. Might improve performance slightly.

- `e9e2b88`: Very low probability. Button styling in AssetVideoSection.
- `74fec46`: Medium probability. Refactored AssetVideoSection to use VideoGallerySection. Updated VideoCard aspect ratio logic to use displayW/H (could be broken if VideoGrid changed).
- `93b2083`: Medium probability. Added framer-motion animations and tablet breakpoint to VideoGrid. Animation complexity and responsive changes could affect mobile.
- `cb58040`: Low probability. Fix for VideoGrid layout flicker.
- `0b34e1b`: Very low probability. VideoGrid animation conflict fix.
- `30de6a2`: Low probability. VideoGrid animation refinement.
- `92cd94a`: Very low probability. Reverted VideoGrid key change.
- `f6f2f03`: Medium-High probability. Refactored VideoGrid to use flex-wrap instead of rows. Major change to layout structure that could affect mobile responsiveness/interaction.
- `bfd5c74`: Very low probability. Reduced pagination size.
- `ccef762`: Medium probability. Added entry animations to VideoGrid tiles. Potential mobile performance impact.
- `53f048d`: Medium-High probability. Added progressive grid loading (scroll-based rendering), lightbox query param handling, and changes to StorageVideoPlayer load timing.
